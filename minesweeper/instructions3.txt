INSTRUCTIONS
============
The aim of MineSweeper is to determine the locations of 10 bombs, randomly placed in a 9x9 grid.
On each go, you type in the coordinates of a square, e.g. E4.
If there is a bomb in that square, you lose. Otherwise, the number of bombs directly surrounding that square, including diagonally, will appear in that square.
If that number is a 0, the squares around it will be 'opened' automatically.
If that number is not zero, the possibility of there being a bomb in both the diagonal and non-diagonal positions will be displayed outside the grid.
If you want to know this information for a square that is already open, type the coordinates of that square, e.g. E4.
If you think you know the position of a bomb, type 'M' followed by the coordinates of that square, e.g. ME4.
You win by 'opening' all of the squares except those with bombs in.

Good luck!
