# Minesweeper (Python 3.x)

### Do not re-use without permission.
A command-line version of minesweeper, designed for a decision-making experiment. Inspired by the Repl.it tutorial (https://repl.it/talk/learn/How-to-program-MineSweeper-in-Python-fully-explained-in-depth-tutorial/9397)

The original Minesweeper was tweaked a little for an experimental paradigm. Divided into three parts (Mines1.py, Mines2.py, Mines3.py), each with varying amounts of information.

Please save .py and .txt files in the same folder before running the program.

Upon running each program, the player is asked for their name, type of trial ('P' for practice, 'T' for test) and the trial number (1, 2, 3...).
